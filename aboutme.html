<h1>About Me</h1>

<h3>Age: 16</h3>
<h3>Sex: Female<h3>
<h3>DOB: 04/13/2001<h3>
<h5>I was born in Seattle, Washington. I have a brother and sister both younger than me. I speak Spanish fluently and I sometimes do 
  interpretation for people in my community during events. I'm a junior currently attending Nathan Hale Hale High School. I'm a Master 
  Compost Builder and I am currently finishing my require hours.
  I am very involved in my community. I was in committee called Imagine Lake City Together. We were given a grant from Wells 
  Fargo Foundation and we worked together trying to get information from the community about their thoughts of Lake City.In the summer
  of 2015 I was a teen leader for the North Seattle Family Resource Center. I volunteer in events when help is  needed. I'm a mentor 
  in Powerful Voices and I sometimes teach on some of their workshops.</h5>
